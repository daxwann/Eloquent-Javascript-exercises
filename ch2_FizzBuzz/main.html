        <h1>Chapter 2: FizzBuzz</h1>
        <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1
                to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
                instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
                "Buzz" instead.</p>
        <p>When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" ,
                for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or
                "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
                (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed
                out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved
                it, youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)</p>
        <script>
            function printNumbers () {
                let num = 0;
                for (let i=0; i<100; i++) {
                    num = i + 1;
                    let numDisplay = num;
                    if (num%3==0 && num%5==0) {
                        numDisplay = "FizzBuzz"; 
                    } else if (num%3==0 && num%5!=0) {
                        numDisplay = "Fizz";
                    } else if (num%3!=0 && num%5==0) {
                        numDisplay = "Buzz";
                    }

                console.log(numDisplay);
                }
            }
