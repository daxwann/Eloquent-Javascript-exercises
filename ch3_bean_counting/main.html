        <h1>Chapter 3: Bean counting</h1>
        <p>You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".
                charAt(N) , similar to how you get its length with "s".length . The returned
                value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"
                ). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to
                be found at position string.length - 1 . In other words, a two-character
                string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and
                returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are
                in the string.</p>
        <p>Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs , except
                it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be
                counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite
                countBs to make use of this new function.</p>
        <script>
            function countBs(inputStr) {
                let charB = "B";
                
                return countChar(inputStr, charB);
            }

            function countChar(inputStr, targetChar) {
                let strLength = inputStr.length;
                let counter = 0;

                for (let strPosition=0; strPosition<strLength; strPosition++) {
                    if (inputStr.charAt(strPosition)==targetChar) {
                        counter++;
                    }
                }

                return counter;
            }

            console.log(countBs("BASKETBALL"));
