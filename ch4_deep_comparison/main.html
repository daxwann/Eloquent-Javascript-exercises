        <h1>Chapter 4: Deep comparison</h1>
        <p>The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes, you would
            prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.</p>
        <p>Write a function, deepEqual , that takes two values and returns true only
            if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties whose
            values are also equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.</p>
        <p>To find out whether to compare two things by identity (use the ===
            operator for that) or by looking at their properties, you can use the
            typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a
            deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account:
            by a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".</p>
